# 🧪 Project Lab

Welcome to **Project Lab** — my personal development lab where I build, break, and explore real-world projects.

This repo is a curated collection of backend-oriented projects, cloned frontend integrations, and practical mini-systems. Whether it's replicating parts of an e-commerce platform, testing out JWT authentication, or building scalable APIs, everything here is aimed at strengthening my development muscle.

## 🔍 What to Expect

- 💻 Real-world backend architecture (Node.js, Express, MongoDB, etc.)
- 🔐 Authentication systems with JWT, sessions, and role-based access
- 🧱 Modular folder structures with MVC patterns
- 🔄 RESTful APIs built from scratch
- 🧩 Integrations with cloned or simple frontends
- ⚙️ Projects I build while following YouTube tutorials or exploring ideas on my own

> 🏷️ You’ll notice a naming pattern across folders:  
> - Projects that end with `-yt` are built while following YouTube tutorials. 
> - Others without the prefix are self-initiated projects built from scratch.

## 🚧 Why I Built This

To keep practicing regularly, avoid forgetting development flow, and stay consistent — even with small practice ideas. `project-lab` acts as a dev journal of progress, reflecting both structured learning and creative experimentation.
