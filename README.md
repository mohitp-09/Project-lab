# 🧪 Project Lab

Welcome to **Project Lab** — my personal development lab where I build, break, and explore real-world projects.

This repo is a curated collection of backend-oriented projects, cloned frontend integrations, and practical mini-systems. Whether it's replicating parts of an e-commerce platform, testing out JWT authentication, or building scalable APIs, everything here is aimed at strengthening my development muscle.

## 🔍 What to Expect

- 💻 Real-world backend architecture (Node.js, Express, MongoDB, etc.)
- 🔐 Authentication systems with JWT, sessions, and role-based access
- 🧱 Modular folder structures with MVC patterns
- 🔄 RESTful APIs built from scratch
- 🧩 Integrations with cloned or simple frontends
- ⚙️ Projects I build while following YouTube tutorials or exploring ideas on my own

> 🏷️ Folder Naming Convention:
> - Folder names follow the format: `ProjectName-ProjectType[-YT]`
> - `ProjectType` can be one of:
>   - `UIOnly`: Frontend practice only
>   - `Clone`: Cloned version of an existing website/app
>   - `miniProject`: Small, focused projects built to practice concepts
>   - `Project`: Full-featured apps with proper structure and UI
> - Projects ending with `-YT` were built by following YouTube tutorials, often enhanced with personal modifications
> - Projects **without** the `-YT` suffix are self-initiated and built from scratch

## 🚧 Why I Built This

To keep practicing regularly, avoid forgetting development flow, and stay consistent — even with small practice ideas. `project-lab` acts as a dev journal of progress, reflecting both structured learning and creative experimentation.
